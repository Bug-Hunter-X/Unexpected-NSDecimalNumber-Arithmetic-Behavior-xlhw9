This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Objective-C when working with `NSDecimalNumber`: incorrect use of arithmetic operators. The `bug.m` file showcases code that uses the `+` and `-` operators directly on `NSDecimalNumber` objects, which can lead to inaccurate results. The `bugSolution.m` file provides the correct approach using the designated `NSDecimalNumber` methods for addition and subtraction, ensuring accurate calculations.
