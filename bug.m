In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSDecimalNumber`.  Improper use of its arithmetic methods can lead to unexpected results, especially when precision is critical. For example, directly adding or subtracting `NSDecimalNumber` instances using `+` or `-` operators will not work. Instead, you must use the dedicated `decimalNumberByAdding:` or `decimalNumberBySubtracting:` methods.
